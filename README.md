# Angular training

Support files for my training on JavaScript, TypeScript & Angular.

## Prerequisites
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/).
1. Install [MS VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
1. Fork this repo.
1. `npm install`

Then you can start the course by opening this project in VS Code.

VS Code will ask you to install some recommended extensions. Accept it.

After that, open the first file in the `src` dir.

Have fun!

**PS.:** This is a live repo. I will add more information as classes progress. After that, you'll need to [sync your fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) to get the latest updates.
