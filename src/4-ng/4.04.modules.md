## Angular Modules

1. What's a module?
1. Metadata: imports, exports, declarations, providers and bootstrap.
   - HTML files in your module will use components, directives & pipes that belong to the same module. List them in the `declarations` array, so your HTML can find them.
   - If the component/directive/pipe that your HTML file needs belongs to a different module, list that external module in the `imports` array.
   - When you `import` an external module, you get everything that is listed in the `exports` array of that module.
   - The `providers` array of a module adds providers to the app's **root dependency injector**, making those services (and values, because it can provide values too) available **everywhere** in the application. We will talk more about this later.
1. The `AppModule`, the only one that is required.
   - It is bootstraped by `main.ts`.
   - It bootstraps our root component: `AppComponent`.
1. `CoreModule` exists to clear the `AppModule`.
   - It is imported only once.
   - It provides stuff.
   - It declares & exports stuff required by the `app.component.html`.
1. `SharedModule` exists so you don't have to import the same modules everytime.
   - Everybody imports the `SharedModule`.
   - It does not provide stuff.
1. One additional module for each feature of our app. They can be lazy loaded (downloaded on first use).

Create your `CoreModule` and `SharedModule`, then commit your changes.
