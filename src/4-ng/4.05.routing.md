## App Routes

Our app comprises the following routes:

| Route            | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| /                | Redirects to the store |
| /error           | 404 or runtime error |
| /login           | Login Page |
| /shop            | Store - you buy stuff here |
| /my-orders       | Stuff that you bought |
| /admin           | Redirects to admin/users |
| /admin/users     | User List |
| /admin/users/:id | User Form |
| /admin/products  | Product CRUD |

Routes are usually defined in Routing Modules. Let's create a root-level one plus an additional routing file for each feature module of our app:

| File | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `/src/app/app.routing.ts` | General routes like home & error pages |
| `/src/app/login/login.routing.ts` | Routes of the Login feature |
| `/src/app/shop/shop.routing.ts` | Routes of the Store feature |
| `/src/app/my-orders/my-orders.routing.ts` | Routes of the My Orders feature |
| `/src/app/admin/admin.routing.ts` | Admin routes. These are interesting. |
