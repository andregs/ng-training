## The Template Pack

Copy the contents of the `4.03.template-pack` dir into the `src` dir of your project.

Answer `yes` to override files.

The pack is just a bunch of static HTML + style sheets that I'm providing so we can save a lot of time.

### Things You Should Notice

1. `.angular-cli.json` -> We added a reference to the Bootstrap style sheet.
1. `index.html` -> We configured the Bootstrap v4 Theme.
1. The global style sheet and how it differs from the inner (app) style sheets.

Commit your changes.
