## Generating Boilerplate Code

The following file is a batch script. Run it to install Bootstrap for Angular and generate boilerplate code.

After that, commit your changes.

### Commands in the Batch

1. `ng i -S` -> installs an external lib and saves it as a dependency in the `package.json` file.
1. `ng g m` -> generates a new module.
1. `ng g c` -> generates a new component.

ğŸ’¡ The `--flat` option (boolean) indicates if the module/component will be generated in the current directory (true) or in a new one (false/default).

ğŸ’¡ Use `ng help generate` for more info on everything that can be generated by the CLI.
